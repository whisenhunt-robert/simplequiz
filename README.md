# Overview

This was my attempt to make a basic quiz program to demonstrate what I learned in the C++ language.
I couldn't figure out what I did wrong because it kept giving me errors.
Even though I downloaded and installed what was required, it keeps saying I'm missing something.

I wrote this code for the purpose that I was able to prove to myself that I understood C++, but clearly I have more to learn.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- C++ Programming Language
- C++ Compiler
- Extension Pack for C++ in VS Code
- Git & GitHub

C++ is an object-oriented programming language that allows you to create many different things.
I was told by a friend that you could make a basic quiz type of game, which is what I was going for.

# Future Work

- Figure out what I did wrong so that I can correct it and have the quiz run successfully.
- Create a video tutorial on what I did to create this program to help others do the same.
- Add more questions to the quiz game once I get it working properly.
